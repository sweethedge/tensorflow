      "supportivebr A recent work (Bhuiyan et al., 2004) in the SCNT bovine field demonstrated that transfected ear fibroblasts were less able to develop to the blastocyst stage than their non-transfected counterpart, regardless of passage number (early or late). More likely, discrepancies among results reported up to now are due to differences in vector type, transfection protocols (Bhuiyan et al., 2004), NT methods and donor cell culture conditions (Wells et al., 2003; Miyoshi et al., 2003). Furthermore, the site of gene(s) integration(s), the transgene used and its possible interference in endogenous gene expression could influence results (Hodges and Stice, 2003). Another aspect to consider is donor cell lines and genotypes, since Heyman et al. (2002) found that four different subcultures isolated from a single skin biopsy resulted in significantly different NT blastocyst rates (ranging from 5 to 30%), and Kühholzer et al. (2001) even found different morula and blastocyst rates among clonal colonies obtained from the same donor cell fetus. In our investigation of in vivo developmental capacity after transfer of NT embryos to recipient cows, we did not observe significant differences in initial pregnancy (< day 40 of gestation) rates between transfected and non-transfected donor cells, which was also reported by Zakhartchenko et al. (2001). In contrast, Forsberg et al. (2002) reported lower rates of initial pregnancy for NT of transfected cells than for NT of non-transfected cells. In our study, the small number of recipients carrying transgenic and non-transgenic cloned embryos precludes a conclusive result concerning embryo survival to term. Nevertheless, we suggest that to some extent transfection procedures negatively affect fetal viability, since non-transgenic pregnancies were miscarried during the first trimester of gestation, though one initial TFCE pregnancy (44 days of gestation) was interrupted. On the other hand, two pregnancies of the FCE group were carried to term. This is supported by the findings of Zakhartchenko et al. (2001) and Brophy et al. (2003) who observed a lower pregnancy rate (> day 30 of gestation) and a lower proportion of viable calves at weaning for NT using transfected cells than for their non-transfected counterpart.\n",

More likely, discrepancies among results reported up to now are due to differences in vector type, transfection protocols (Bhuiyan et al., 2004), NT methods and donor cell culture conditions (Wells et al., 2003; Miyoshi et al., 2003). Furthermore, the site of gene(s) integration(s), the transgene used and its possible interference in endogenous gene expression could influence results (Hodges and Stice, 2003). Another aspect to consider is donor cell lines and genotypes, since Heyman et al. (2002) found that four different subcultures isolated from a single skin biopsy resulted in significantly different NT blastocyst rates (ranging from 5 to 30%), and Kühholzer et al. (2001) even found different morula and blastocyst rates among clonal colonies obtained from the same donor cell fetus. In our investigation of in vivo developmental capacity after transfer of NT embryos to recipient cows, we did not observe significant differences in initial pregnancy (< day 40 of gestation) rates between transfected and non-transfected donor cells, which was also reported by Zakhartchenko et al. (2001). In contrast, Forsberg et al. (2002) reported lower rates of initial pregnancy for NT of transfected cells than for NT of non-transfected cells. In our study, the small number of recipients carrying transgenic and non-transgenic cloned embryos precludes a conclusive result concerning embryo survival to term. Nevertheless, we suggest that to some extent transfection procedures negatively affect fetal viability, since non-transgenic pregnancies were miscarried during the first trimester of gestation, though one initial TFCE pregnancy (44 days of gestation) was interrupted. On the other hand, two pregnancies of the FCE group were carried to term. This is supported by the findings of Zakhartchenko et al. (2001) and Brophy et al.

More likely, discrepancies among results reported up to now are due to differences in vector type, transfection protocols (Bhuiyan et al., 2004), NT methods and donor cell culture conditions (Wells et al., 2003; Miyoshi et al., 2003). Furthermore, the site of gene(s) integration(s), the transgene used and its possible interference in endogenous gene expression could influence results (Hodges and Stice, 2003). Another aspect to consider is donor cell lines and genotypes, since Heyman et al. (2002) found that four different subcultures isolated from a single skin biopsy resulted in significantly different NT blastocyst rates (ranging from 5 to 30%), and Kühholzer et al. (2001) even found different morula and blastocyst rates among clonal colonies obtained from the same donor cell fetus. In our investigation of in vivo developmental capacity after transfer of NT embryos to recipient cows, we did not observe significant differences in initial pregnancy (< day 40 of gestation) rates between transfected and non-transfected donor cells, which was also reported by Zakhartchenko et al. (2001). In contrast, Forsberg et al. (2002) reported lower rates of initial pregnancy for NT of transfected cells than for NT of non-transfected cells. In our study, the small number of recipients carrying transgenic and non-transgenic cloned embryos precludes a conclusive result concerning embryo survival to term. Nevertheless, we suggest that to some extent transfection procedures negatively affect fetal viability, since non-transgenic pregnancies were miscarried during the first trimester of gestation, though one initial TFCE pregnancy (44 days of gestation) was interrupted. On the other hand, two pregnancies of the FCE group were carried to term. This is supported by the findings of Zakhartchenko et al. (2001) and Brophy et al. (2003) who observed a lower pregnancy rate (> day 30 of gestation) and a lower proportion of viable calves at weaning for NT using transfected cells than for their non-transfected counterpart.\n",

      "supportivebr A recent work (Bhuiyan et al., 2004) in the SCNT bovine field demonstrated that transfected ear fibroblasts were less able to develop to the blastocyst stage than their non-transfected counterpart, regardless of passage number (early or late). More likely, discrepancies among results reported up to now are due to differences in vector type, transfection protocols (Bhuiyan et al., 2004), NT methods and donor cell culture conditions (Wells et al., 2003; Miyoshi et al., 2003). Furthermore, the site of gene(s) integration(s), the transgene used and its possible interference in endogenous gene expression could influence results (Hodges and Stice, 2003). Another aspect to consider is donor cell lines and genotypes, since Heyman et al. (2002) found that four different subcultures isolated from a single skin biopsy resulted in significantly different NT blastocyst rates (ranging from 5 to 30%), and Kühholzer et al. (2001) even found different morula and blastocyst rates among clonal colonies obtained from the same donor cell fetus. In our investigation of in vivo developmental capacity after transfer of NT embryos to recipient cows, we did not observe significant differences in initial pregnancy (< day 40 of gestation) rates between transfected and non-transfected donor cells, which was also reported by Zakhartchenko et al. (2001). In contrast, Forsberg et al. (2002) reported lower rates of initial pregnancy for NT of transfected cells than for NT of non-transfected cells. In our study, the small number of recipients carrying transgenic and non-transgenic cloned embryos precludes a conclusive result concerning embryo survival to term. Nevertheless, we suggest that to some extent transfection procedures negatively affect fetal viability, since non-transgenic pregnancies were miscarried during the first trimester of gestation, though one initial TFCE pregnancy (44 days of gestation) was interrupted. On the other hand, two pregnancies of the FCE group were carried to term. This is supported by the findings of Zakhartchenko et al. (2001) and Brophy et al. (2003) who observed a lower pregnancy rate (> day 30 of gestation) and a lower proportion of viable calves at weaning for NT using transfected cells than for their non-transfected counterpart.\n",

      "supportivebr A recent work (Bhuiyan et al., 2004) in the SCNT bovine field demonstrated that transfected ear fibroblasts were less able to develop to the blastocyst stage than their non-transfected counterpart, regardless of passage number (early or late). More likely, discrepancies among results reported up to now are due to differences in vector type, transfection protocols (Bhuiyan et al., 2004), NT methods and donor cell culture conditions (Wells et al., 2003; Miyoshi et al., 2003). Furthermore, the site of gene(s) integration(s), the transgene used and its possible interference in endogenous gene expression could influence results (Hodges and Stice, 2003). Another aspect to consider is donor cell lines and genotypes, since Heyman et al. (2002) found that four different subcultures isolated from a single skin biopsy resulted in significantly different NT blastocyst rates (ranging from 5 to 30%), and Kühholzer et al. (2001) even found different morula and blastocyst rates among clonal colonies obtained from the same donor cell fetus. In our investigation of in vivo developmental capacity after transfer of NT embryos to recipient cows, we did not observe significant differences in initial pregnancy (< day 40 of gestation) rates between transfected and non-transfected donor cells, which was also reported by Zakhartchenko et al. (2001). In contrast, Forsberg et al. (2002) reported lower rates of initial pregnancy for NT of transfected cells than for NT of non-transfected cells. In our study, the small number of recipients carrying transgenic and non-transgenic cloned embryos precludes a conclusive result concerning embryo survival to term. Nevertheless, we suggest that to some extent transfection procedures negatively affect fetal viability, since non-transgenic pregnancies were miscarried during the first trimester of gestation, though one initial TFCE pregnancy (44 days of gestation) was interrupted. On the other hand, two pregnancies of the FCE group were carried to term. This is supported by the findings of Zakhartchenko et al. (2001) and Brophy et al. (2003) who observed a lower pregnancy rate (> day 30 of gestation) and a lower proportion of viable calves at weaning for NT using transfected cells than for their non-transfected counterpart.\n",
